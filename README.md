This repository includes some code files to learn about using Python for scientific/engineering purposes. In the "src" folder you will find several scripts to learn Python for everyday tasks.

Before downloaded any scripts, I'd recommend installing both

1) The newest version of Python 3 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

2) Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/
	
	Anaconda is a scientific Python distribution that includes Spyder, a popular integrated development environment (IDE). Spyder features a MATLAB/R-like interface which allows for rapid development and analysis. Other options for IDEs include PyCharm and Rodeo (still in Beta).
